# Terminal To-Do List

## What's inside
Just a basic To-Do List the user can use via the terminal.
When the program is started an empty to-do list is created that the user can then perform CRUD operations on. Specifically, the user is prompted to enter a number into the terminal from 1-5. Each of those numbers trigger a different operation:
1 - See all items in the to-do list
2 - Add a new item
3 - Check an item off
4 - Update an item
5 - Quit the application
